### Patch Changes

- [#11](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-lint/pull/11) [`00b9e79`](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-lint/commit/00b9e79abc81e7f540a24aaa1892322718155d66) Thanks [@kmelve](https://github.com/kmelve)! - Add CommonJS exports to all library packages

  All library packages now export both ESM and CJS formats, fixing compatibility
  issues with ESLint configurations that use `require()` or FlatCompat.
  - @sanity/lint-core: ESM + CJS
  - @sanity/groq-lint: ESM + CJS (library), ESM only (CLI)
  - @sanity/schema-lint: ESM + CJS
  - @sanity/prettier-plugin-groq: ESM + CJS

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @sanity/groq-wasm@0.0.1
